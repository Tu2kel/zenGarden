            Littering a dark and dreary
            road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS support,
            and abandoned browsers.<br><br> We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
            thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the
            W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators. <br> <br> The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on
            the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity.
            Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

            <p class="top2">

            <header class="topTitle">SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</header>

            There is a continuing need to
            show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
            participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load
            the style sheet
            into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS
            file. Yes, really.<br> <br> CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document.
            The only way this can be illustrated in a
            way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the
            hands of those
            able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the
            web; we can
            always push it further.</p>

            <p> Strong visual design has always been our
                focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are necessary too, but
                the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points.
                Please see the CSS
                Resource Guide for advanced tutorials and tips on working with CSS. <br><br> You may modify the style
                sheet
                in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if you've never
                worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
                <br><br> Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your
                masterpiece (and please, don't
                submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under your control. Send us a link to an
                archive of that
                file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our
                server.

            <p> Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2
                usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported elements
                only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and
                not the latest
                bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that
                your CSS
                validates. <br><br>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by
                now.
                When sticking to the guidelines
                you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
                agents on the web
                these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across
                every platform.
                That's okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+ and the latest
                Chrome, Firefox,
                iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population). <br><br>We ask that you submit original
                artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a minimum,
                and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We're well past the point of
                needing another
                garden-related design. <br><br>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
                copyright on your graphics (with limited
                exceptions, see submission guidelines), but we ask you release your CSS under a Creative Commons license
                identical to
                the one on this site so that others may learn from your work.</p>
